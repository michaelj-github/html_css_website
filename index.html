        <h1>The Three Constraints</h1>
        <section>
            <h2>Computational Power (CPU/GPU Processing Speed)</h2>
            <p><strong>Definition: </strong>Computational power refers to the ability of a computer’s CPU (Central Processing Unit) or GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) to process and execute instructions. The speed of these processors is often measured in gigahertz (GHz), indicating how many billions of operations they can perform per second.</p>
            <p><strong>Constraints: </strong>The faster the processor, the more calculations and tasks it can perform in a given time. This is crucial for everything from basic computing tasks to complex operations like data analysis, simulations, and running machine learning models. However, physical limitations like heat dissipation and power consumption, as well as manufacturing and material constraints, limit how much processing speed can be increased.</p>
            <p><strong>Developments: </strong>Advancements in processor technology, like multi-core processors, more efficient architectures (like ARM), and specialized processors (like GPUs for parallel processing), have continually pushed the boundaries of computational power.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Storage Capacity</h2>
            <p><strong>Definition: </strong>Storage capacity refers to the amount of data that can be stored on digital storage devices. This includes hard drives, solid-state drives (SSDs), memory cards, and cloud storage solutions.</p>
            <p><strong>Constraints: </strong>The amount of data that can be stored is a crucial factor, especially with the exponential growth of data generation in recent years (big data). Higher storage capacities are needed to handle this data, but physical size, cost, and data retrieval speeds pose limitations.</p>
            <p><strong>Developments: </strong>Technological advancements have led to a significant increase in storage densities (storing more data in less physical space), and the emergence of cloud storage has provided scalable solutions. Innovations like 3D NAND technology in SSDs have also contributed to increased storage capacities.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Bandwidth</h2>
            <p><strong>Definition: </strong>Bandwidth refers to the maximum rate of data transfer across a given path or network connection, measured in bits per second (bps). It determines how much data can be sent or received in a certain amount of time.</p>
            <p><strong>Constraints: </strong>Bandwidth is a critical factor in internet and network performance. Limited bandwidth can lead to slower internet speeds, lag in streaming services, and delays in data-intensive operations like cloud computing or remote server access. Physical infrastructure, signal interference, and network protocols are among the factors that can limit bandwidth.</p>
            <p><strong>Developments: </strong>Developments in fiber-optic technology, 5G wireless networks, and improved networking protocols have led to significant increases in bandwidth capabilities. Additionally, advancements in network infrastructure and optimization techniques continue to enhance data transmission speeds.</p>

            <h2>Impacts and Future Trends</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The continuous push against these constraints drives innovation in IT. For example, quantum computing presents a potential leap in processing power, new storage technologies like DNA data storage offer massive capacities, and emerging networking technologies aim to further increase bandwidth.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The synergy between these three elements is also crucial. For instance, having high computational power with limited storage or bandwidth could bottleneck a system’s overall performance.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Future advancements will likely focus on overcoming physical and material limitations, improving energy efficiency, and integrating new technologies to maintain the growth trajectory in IT capabilities.</p>
                </li>
